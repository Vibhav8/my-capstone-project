<h1>MLND â€“ Leaf Classification Using Neural Network</h1>


<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


This project will use feed forward neural network model for leaf classification.

This project is based on a kaggle competition, leaf classification ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification/)

<h2>Dataset</h2>


The dataset includes:
1) train.csv
2) test.csv
3) images

These files can be downloaded by using below link:

<h2>Library dependencies</h2>


sklearn 0.17.1
pandas 0.18.0
numpy 1.11.1
tensorflow 0.9.0
keras 2.0.8

<h2>Scripts</h2>
